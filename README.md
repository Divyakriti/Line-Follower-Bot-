# Line Follower Robot üöó‚ö°

This project is a **Line Follower Robot** built using an Arduino UNO and an **HW-130 Motor Driver Shield**. It uses a 5-sensor IR array to detect black lines on a white surface and follows the track automatically.

## üîß Features

* **5 IR sensors** for precise line detection.
* **Arduino UNO + HW-130 Motor Driver Shield** for motor control.
* Supports forward, left, right, and stop actions.
* Rechargeable 7.4V battery for portability.

| Component              | Quantity |
|------------------------|----------|
| Arduino UNO            | 1        |
| HW-130 Motor Driver Shield | 1    |
| IR Sensors             | 5        |
| BO Motors              | 2        |
| BO Wheels              | 2        |
| N20 Caster Wheel       | 1        |
| 3.7V Batteries         | 2        |
| Jumper Wires           | As required |
| Robot Chassis          | 1        |



## üìÇ How It Works

1. IR sensor array detects black/white line contrast.
2. Arduino UNO reads the sensor values.
3. HW-130 Motor Driver Shield drives the DC motors.
4. Robot adjusts movement to follow the path smoothly.

Do you also want me to **write the Arduino code (for HW-130 motor driver + 5 IR sensors)** and include it in this README so your GitHub repo is plug-and-play?
